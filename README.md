# WebFlux Security Sample

This is a sample Spring Boot reactive application with WebFlux and security.

Run with `mvn spring-boot:run`.

Then connect to http://localhost:9090/public or http://localhost:9090/private (expects "user" and "pass" with basic authentication).

In progress:
- Security does not work
- Security logs are missing
